# ConvLSTM
This Github is a compilation of all my current Research on ConvLSTM in Glacier Melting Context


I am conducting independent research using a ConvLSTM, a neural network designed to learn how images change over time, to predict the growth of proglacial lakes in Greenland. Using monthly satellite images, terrain data (like elevation and slope), and a physics-based melt indicator, I built a model that forecasts how lake area evolves during melt seasons. I am extending this work by adding physical constraints so the model’s predictions remain realistic, combining machine learning with real glacial science rather than treating the system as a black box. By comparing a standard model with a physics-informed version and analyzing which features matter most, my research explores how AI can better understand and predict climate-driven environmental change. These are my results at the moment.

I am reaching out to multiple professors in the field to double check my findings before I write a paper.
